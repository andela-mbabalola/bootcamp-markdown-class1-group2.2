## Introduction to computer science.
### What is computer science?
Computer science in two words is 'Problem solving'.
> Here are a few other definitions...
- [According to wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)
> Computer science is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)

> Computer science is one of the most amazing art forms in the world. Not only is it incredibly
expressive — allowing for an infinite number of combinations of words, images, and ideas —
but when done well, it produces a functional and useful product that can entertain and
inform the masses. [Read more](https://studio.code.org/unplugged/unplug1.pdf)
- [According to Interactive Python.](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsComputerScience.html)
> Computer science is often difficult to define. This is probably due to the unfortunate use of the word “computer” in the name. As you are perhaps aware, computer science is not simply the study of computers. Although computers play an important supporting role as a tool in the discipline, they are just that–tools.[Read More](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsComputerScience.html)

*Computer science vocabulary.*
- Automate — To make something happen
automatically (without help from people)

- Computer Science—The art of blending
human ideas and digital tools to increase
problem solving power

- Computer Scientist—A person who is skilled
at modifying problems for digital solutions
Data— Information, including: facts, samples,
names and numbers.

- Environment— The world we live in.

- Interface— The way something allows you to
connect with it.

- Open Source— Software that is created for
free use by everyone.

- Programming—Writing instructions for a
digital tool.

- Simulation—Pretending to be (a stand-in
for) the real thing.

_This is a somewhat morderate sum of what computer science is, It should be worthy to being beneficial to you._
