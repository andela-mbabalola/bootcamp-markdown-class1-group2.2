# Introduction to Git

Git is  a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks.
As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed,data integrity, and support for distributed,
non-linear workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, 
with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
It's helps in providing clarity as to:
  - Who made a change in a particular file 
  - Why he made the change
  - When he made the change

> With Git, you can do practically anything offline, because everybody has their own repository
> Making branches and merging between branches is really easy.
> Even if you don't have commit rights for a project, you can still have your own repository online, and publish "push requests" for your patches.
> Everybody who likes your patches can pull them into their project, including the official maintainers.

### Examples of some commands


```sh
$ git init
