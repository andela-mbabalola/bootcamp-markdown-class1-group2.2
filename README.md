# INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT
 ### 1. Purpose of Javascript
 * JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used in building webpages alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented programming, and functional programming styles, It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
 Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two are distinct languages and differ greatly in their design. JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.
 ### 2. Beginings of Javascript
* Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new Web programming language.
#### 3. Advantages of javascript
* Javascript is executed on the client side
This means that the code is executed on the user's processor instead of the web server thus saving bandwidth and strain on the web server.

* Javascript is a relatively easy language
The Javascript language is relatively easy to learn and comprises of syntax that is close to English. It uses the DOM model that provides plenty of prewritten functionality to the various objects on pages making it a breeze to develop a script to solve a custom purpose.

* Javascript is relatively fast to the end user
As the code is executed on the user's computer, results and processing is completed almost instantly depending on the task (tasks in javascript on web pages are usually simple so as to prevent being a memory hog) as it does not need to be processed in the site's web server and sent back to the user consuming local as well as server bandwidth. 

* Extended functionality to web pages
Third party add-ons like [Greasemonkey] [df2] enable Javascript developers to write snippets of Javascript which can execute on desired web pages to extend its functionality. If you use a website and require a certain feature to be included, you can write it yourself and use an add-on like Greasemonkey to implement it on the web page. 

#### 4. Disadvantages

* Security Issues
Javascript snippets, once appended onto web pages execute on client servers immediately and therefore can also be used to exploit the user's system. While a certain restriction is set by modern web standards on browsers, malicious code can still be executed complying with the restrictions set.

* Javascript rendering varies
Different layout engines may render Javascript differently resulting in inconsistency in terms of functionality and interface. While the latest versions of javascript and rendering have been geared towards a universal standard, certain variations still exist.
