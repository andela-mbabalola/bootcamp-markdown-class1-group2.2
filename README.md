## Introduction to computer science.
### What is computer science?
Computer science in two words is 'Problem solving'.
> Here are a few other definitions...
- [According to wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)
> Computer science is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)

> Computer science is one of the most amazing art forms in the world. Not only is it incredibly
expressive — allowing for an infinite number of combinations of words, images, and ideas —
but when done well, it produces a functional and useful product that can entertain and
inform the masses. [Read more](https://studio.code.org/unplugged/unplug1.pdf)
- [According to Interactive Python.](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsComputerScience.html)
> Computer science is often difficult to define. This is probably due to the unfortunate use of the word “computer” in the name. As you are perhaps aware, computer science is not simply the study of computers. Although computers play an important supporting role as a tool in the discipline, they are just that–tools.[Read More](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsComputerScience.html)

*Computer science vocabulary.*
- Automate — To make something happen
automatically (without help from people)

- Computer Science—The art of blending
human ideas and digital tools to increase
problem solving power

- Computer Scientist—A person who is skilled
at modifying problems for digital solutions
Data— Information, including: facts, samples,
names and numbers.

- Environment— The world we live in.

- Interface— The way something allows you to
connect with it.

- Open Source— Software that is created for
free use by everyone.

- Programming—Writing instructions for a
digital tool.

- Simulation—Pretending to be (a stand-in
for) the real thing.

_This is a somewhat morderate sum of what computer science is, It should be worthy to being beneficial to you._

# INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT
 ### 1. Purpose of Javascript
 * JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language used in building webpages alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented imperative, and functional programming styles, It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
 Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two are distinct languages and differ greatly in their design. JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.
 ### 2. Beginings of Javascript
* Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new Web programming language.
#### 3. Advantages of javascript
* Javascript is executed on the client side
This means that the code is executed on the user's processor instead of the web server thus saving bandwidth and strain on the web server.

* Javascript is a relatively easy language
The Javascript language is relatively easy to learn and comprises of syntax that is close to English. It uses the DOM model that provides plenty of prewritten functionality to the various objects on pages making it a breeze to develop a script to solve a custom purpose. As provided by the documentation @ [mozilla ][df1]

* Javascript is relatively fast to the end user
As the code is executed on the user's computer, results and processing is completed almost instantly depending on the task (tasks in javascript on web pages are usually simple so as to prevent being a memory hog) as it does not need to be processed in the site's web server and sent back to the user consuming local as well as server bandwidth. 

* Extended functionality to web pages
Third party add-ons like [Greasemonkey] [df2] enable Javascript developers to write snippets of Javascript which can execute on desired web pages to extend its functionality. If you use a website and require a certain feature to be included, you can write it yourself and use an add-on like Greasemonkey to implement it on the web page. 

#### 4. Disadvantages

* Security Issues
Javascript snippets, once appended onto web pages execute on client servers immediately and therefore can also be used to exploit the user's system. While a certain restriction is set by modern web standards on browsers, malicious code can still be executed complying with the restrictions set.

* Javascript rendering varies
Different layout engines may render Javascript differently resulting in inconsistency in terms of functionality and interface. While the latest versions of javascript and rendering have been geared towards a universal standard, certain variations still exist. Website Usability Consultants all over the world make a living on these differences, but it enrages thousands of developers on a daily basis.

# Introduction to Git

Git is  a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks.
As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed,data integrity, and support for distributed,
non-linear workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, 
with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
It's helps in providing clarity as to:
  - Who made a change in a particular file 
  - Why he made the change
  - When he made the change 

To download Git visit [gitscm][df1] and to get the documentations and tutorial visit [git scm][df1]

> With Git, you can do practically anything offline, because everybody has their own repository
> Making branches and merging between branches is really easy.
> Even if you don't have commit rights for a project, you can still have your own repository online, and publish "push requests" for your patches.
> Everybody who likes your patches can pull them into their project, including the official maintainers.

### Examples of some commands


```sh
$ git init
$ git branch
$ git commit
```
